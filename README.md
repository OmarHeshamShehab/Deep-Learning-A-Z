  - **Description**: This notebook covers the essentials of building and training an ANN model for binary and multi-class classification tasks. It includes:
    - Data preprocessing steps such as scaling and encoding.
    - Model architecture setup using fully connected layers with activation functions.
    - Model training and hyperparameter tuning to optimize accuracy.
    - Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
    - Visualizations of the training process and evaluation metrics to understand the model's performance.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image classification and computer vision tasks. 
This section contains two notebooks that demonstrate building CNN architectures for image processing, focusing on extracting spatial features.

- **File**: `1-CNN.ipynb`
  - **Description**: The first CNN notebook introduces the basic structure of CNNs, including:
    - Understanding convolutional and pooling layers and how they capture spatial hierarchies.
    - Building a simple CNN for image classification.
    - Training the CNN on a sample dataset, adjusting parameters such as filter sizes and strides.
    - Evaluating model performance and visualizing feature maps to gain insights into learned features.

- **File**: `2-CNN.ipynb`
  - **Description**: The second CNN notebook explores advanced concepts and techniques for enhancing CNN models:
    - Implementing additional layers, such as dropout and batch normalization, to improve generalization.
    - Experimenting with more complex architectures and tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.
    - Fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models on new datasets.

  - **Description**: This notebook explores the use of RNNs for sequence prediction and classification tasks, including:
    - Data preparation for sequential data, including time series normalization and sequence padding.
    - Building RNN layers using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) to handle vanishing gradient issues.
    - Training the model on sequential data and interpreting the results.
    - Using the model for applications like stock price prediction, sentiment analysis, or language processing.
    - Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and model visualization for sequence learning.

  - **Description**: This notebook introduces the basics of Self-Organizing Maps, including:
    - Setting up a SOM model to organize data points based on similarity.
    - Visualizing clusters and patterns in the dataset.
    - Analyzing and interpreting the SOM output to uncover hidden structures in the data.
    - Practical applications for SOMs in tasks such as market segmentation and anomaly detection.

- **File**: `2-mega_case_study.ipynb`
  - **Description**: This comprehensive case study applies SOMs to a larger, real-world dataset:
    - Using SOMs for clustering and identifying unique patterns in high-dimensional data.
    - Step-by-step walkthrough of a complete data science workflow, including data preprocessing, SOM training, and evaluation.
    - Visualizations and interpretation of clustering results to showcase the power of SOMs in complex data scenarios.
    - Discussion on real-world applications of SOMs, such as customer segmentation, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.
